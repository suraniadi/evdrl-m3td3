# Competitive Reinforcement Learning for Real-Time Pricing and Scheduling Control in Coupled EV Charging Stations and Power Networks

PyTorch implementation of Minimax Multi-Agent Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (M3TD3). 

Networks are trained using [PyTorch 1.11](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) and Python 3.9.16. 

### Usage
The paper results can be reproduced by running:

### Results
Code is no longer exactly representative of the code used in the paper. Minor adjustments to hyperparamters, etc, to improve performance. Learning curves are still the original results found in the paper.

Code adapted from the following [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09477).
